## This folder contains multiple files for adjusting PRS of six diseases in a single sample.

## The input file has to be normalized to have real REF and ALT, and the SNP IDs have to be CHR:POSP:REF:ALT

# R script file 
prs_adjustment_single_sample.R: Run as below:
Rscript prs_adjustment_single_sample.R sample_raw_score sample_raw_pc eigenval pc_model
The four arguments are: 
sample_raw_score: PRS raw score file output from plink2 --score
sample_raw_pc: plink bed/bim/fam file containing a single sample file
eigenval: the ref_pcs.eigenval file containing 4 eigen values for 4 first PCs
pc_model: A linear model saved in a file for a specific disease, e.g., af_pc_model.RDS shown as below

# ref_pcs files are from Plink2 PCA analysis:
#ref_pcs.log: output log file of Plink/2.oa PCA using MGB biobank samples of 8 batches. This is file is not required.
ref_pcs.acount:  pca analysis resulting data containing 16443 variant frequency, will be used in new sample projection to PC space
ref_pcs.eigenval: pca analysis resulting data containing 4 eigen values for 4 first PCs, will be used for scalling of new sample projection PCs
ref_pcs.eigenvec: pca analysis resulting data containing 4 PC for all samples
ref_pcs.eigenved.newid: the sample FID and IID in ref_pcs.eigenved are modified so that they have same format
ref_pcs.eigenvec.var: pca analysis resulting data containing all variants' weights

# .RDS files are PRS ~ PC1 + PC2 + PC3 + PC4 models for six diseases
af_pc_model.RDS: linear model for AF
cad_pc_model.RDS: linear model for CAD
t2d_pc_model.RDS: linear model for T2D
breastC_pc_model.RDS: linear model for breastC
colorectalC_pc_model.RDS: linear model for colorectalC
prostateC_pc_model.RDS: linear model for prostateC

# race informative variants list of 16385 generated as below. This file is used to filter the new sample in the process of PC projection
